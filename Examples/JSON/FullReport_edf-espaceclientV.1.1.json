[{"meta":{"task_overview":{"description":"You will receive a JSON object with: meta { priming, instructions }, reports: [ { url, domain, tld, subdomain, path, script, findings } ], scriptPreviews. Inside each report’s findings array are objects { \"signal\": string, \"source\": string }. Explain what each signal means in context: connect headers, TLS, scripts, cookies, and redirect behavior into a coherent security-analysis narrative. Do not just repeat the findings; show how multiple signals combine into a pattern (e.g., “missing HSTS + new certificate + high script density → potential phishing kit”). Use the user’s preferred language/locale found in key: \"output_language\".","output_language":"en","expected_output":"Use plain, accessible language. Avoid unexplained acronyms. Think like you’re coaching a cautious user who wants to know, “Can I trust this link?”","output_style":"Be clear and neutral—if you see suspicious behavior, say so; if you see valid reasons (e.g., a known CDN cookie), explain why it may be acceptable."},"model_context":{"request_context":"Each HTTP GET is a clean mobile visit: no cookies, no referrer, no local storage. This ensures you see only the site’s true behavior.","data_purpose":"The model receives real observed behaviors—headers, cookies, TLS details, scripts, redirects. They are not hypothetical; they reflect exactly what the server sent.","behavioral_context":"Frame every finding from the perspective of a cautious first-time visitor: what does this signal tell them about trust or risk?","modelBehavior":"Connect multiple findings into patterns. If you see “high entropy cookie” + “no CSP” + “Redirect loop,” call out why they matter together.","script_inline_reasoning":"For inline scripts: look for obfuscated code, eval/atob, or missing nonces. Explain if inline JS might hide malicious logic.","script_external_reasoning":"For external scripts: note missing SRI, generic file names (payload.js), or protocol-relative URLs. These often signal phishing/cloaking.","tracking_nuance":"When cookies have high entropy or SameSite=None, identify them as potential fingerprinting/tracking. Acknowledge legitimate CDN cookies but still note profiling risk.","tls_context":"Check certificate age—very new certificates can signal throwaway phishing sites. Note if the CA is trustworthy or potentially malicious.","header_nuance":"If HSTS is missing on a 200 response, flag it unless the domain is preloaded. Missing X-Content-Type-Options or Referrer-Policy always merit mention.","reasoning_expectation":"Go beyond listing. For example: “Although the certificate is domain-validated, it’s only 4 days old; combined with missing security headers, that suggests poor hygiene or a phishing kit.”","consumer_protection_lens":"Summarize each section in a way that a non-technical user can understand: explain why each risky behavior (or each safe behavior) matters for everyday browsing."}}},{"reports":[{"url":"https://edf-espaceclient.site/","domain":"edf-espaceclient","tld":"site","subdomain":null,"path":"/","query":null,"fragment":null,"punycoded_host":"edf-espaceclient.site","requested_url":"edf-espaceclient.site/","response_code":200,"status_text":"no error","tls":{"certificate_policy":"Domain Validation","issuer_common_name":"R10 , edf-espaceclient.site","not_after":"2025-09-07T10:22:34Z","not_before":"2025-06-09T10:22:35Z","number_of_san":1},"number_of_cookies":0,"headers":{"accept_ranges":"bytes","content_encoding":"br","content_length":"376","content_type":"text/html","date":"Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:23:54 GMT","etag":"\"b27befaa2fd9db1:0\"","last_modified":"Mon, 09 Jun 2025 11:14:29 GMT","server":"Microsoft-IIS/10.0","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x_powered_by":"ASP.NET","x_powered_by_plesk":"PleskWin"},"scripts":{"summary":{"count":{"inline":1,"external":1},"size":{"total_inline_bytes":40,"largest_inline":40,"average_inline":40},"flags":{"inline_with_nonce":0,"inline_suspicious":1,"external_with_sri":0,"external_with_crossorigin":0},"density_of_scripts_per_kilobyte":4.2000000000000002},"inline_scripts":[{"size":40,"has_nonce":false,"is_module":false,"findings":["Document.Write call detected","DOM manipulation via document.write()"],"snippets_findings":["inline_script_1"]}],"external_script_groups":[{"path_prefix":"https://assets.plesk.com/static","count":1,"suffixes":["/default-website-content/public/default-website-index.js"],"sri_present":false,"crossorigin_present":false,"group_type":"absolute_or_protocol_relative"}]},"findings":[{"signal":"⚠️ The TLD '.site' is commonly associated with suspicious domains.","source":"host"},{"signal":"High script density detected (2.188) script per 1000 bytes.
