    [{"meta":{"task_overview":{"description":"You will receive a JSON object with: meta { priming, instructions }, reports: [ { url, domain, tld, subdomain, path, script, findings } ], scriptPreviews. Inside each report’s findings array are objects { \"signal\": string, \"source\": string }. Explain what each signal means in context: connect headers, TLS, scripts, cookies, and redirect behavior into a coherent security-analysis narrative. Do not just repeat the findings; show how multiple signals combine into a pattern (e.g., “missing HSTS + new certificate + high script density → potential phishing kit”). Use the user’s preferred language/locale found in key: \"output_language\".","output_language":"en","expected_output":"Use plain, accessible language. Avoid unexplained acronyms. Think like you’re coaching a cautious user who wants to know, “Can I trust this link?”","output_style":"Be clear and neutral—if you see suspicious behavior, say so; if you see valid reasons (e.g., a known CDN cookie), explain why it may be acceptable."},"model_context":{"request_context":"Each HTTP GET is a clean mobile visit: no cookies, no referrer, no local storage. This ensures you see only the site’s true behavior.","data_purpose":"The model receives real observed behaviors—headers, cookies, TLS details, scripts, redirects. They are not hypothetical; they reflect exactly what the server sent.","behavioral_context":"Frame every finding from the perspective of a cautious first-time visitor: what does this signal tell them about trust or risk?","modelBehavior":"Connect multiple findings into patterns. If you see “high entropy cookie” + “no CSP” + “Redirect loop,” call out why they matter together.","script_inline_reasoning":"For inline scripts: look for obfuscated code, eval/atob, or missing nonces. Explain if inline JS might hide malicious logic. ","script_external_reasoning":"For external scripts: note missing SRI, generic file names (payload.js), or protocol-relative URLs. These often signal phishing/cloaking.","scriptSnippet":"When script previews are provided, consider them part of your core analysis. Don’t ignore or down-rank them simply because stronger signals are present.","tracking_nuance":"When cookies have high entropy or SameSite=None, identify them as potential fingerprinting/tracking. Acknowledge legitimate CDN cookies but still note profiling risk.","tls_context":"Check certificate age—very new certificates can signal throwaway phishing sites. Note if the CA is trustworthy or potentially malicious.","header_nuance":"If HSTS is missing on a 200 response, flag it unless the domain is preloaded. Missing X-Content-Type-Options or Referrer-Policy always merit mention.","reasoning_expectation":"Go beyond listing. For example: “Although the certificate is domain-validated, it’s only 4 days old; combined with missing security headers, that suggests poor hygiene or a phishing kit.”","consumer_protection_lens":"Summarize each section in a way that a non-technical user can understand: explain why each risky behavior (or each safe behavior) matters for everyday browsing."}}},{"reports":[{"url":"https://mehdiekang.hosted.phplist.com/lists/?p=subscribe&id=1","domain":"phplist","tld":"com","subdomain":"mehdiekang.hosted","path":"/lists/","query":"p=subscribe&id=1","fragment":null,"punycoded_host":"mehdiekang.hosted.phplist.com","requested_url":"mehdiekang.hosted.phplist.com/lists/","response_code":200,"status_text":"no error","tls":{"certificate_policy":"Domain Validation","issuer_common_name":"R10 , *.hosted.phplist.com","not_after":"2025-07-18T03:21:15Z","not_before":"2025-04-19T03:21:16Z","number_of_san":1},"number_of_cookies":2,"cookie_detail":[{"key":"WebblerSession","value_entropy":"3.9","value_length":26,"same_site_policy":"strict","secure":true,"http_only":true,"expires":{"type":"session"}},{"key":"SERVERID","value_entropy":"3.6","value_length":21,"same_site_policy":"lax","secure":true,"http_only":true,"expires":{"type":"session"}}],"headers":{"access_control_allow_origin":"*","cache_control":"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate","content_encoding":"gzip","content_length":"894","content_type":"text/html; charset=UTF-8","date":"Sat, 21 Jun 2025 05:18:43 GMT","expires":"Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT","pragma":"no-cache","server":"Apache/2.4.59 (Debian)","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"scripts":{"summary":{"count":{"inline":0,"external":0},"size":{"total_inline_bytes":0,"largest_inline":0,"average_inline":0},"flags":{"inline_with_nonce":0,"inline_suspicious":0,"external_with_sri":0,"external_with_crossorigin":0},"density_of_scripts_per_kilobyte":"0.0"},"inline_scripts":[],"external_script_groups":[]},"findings":[{"signal":"Missing closing </html> tag.
